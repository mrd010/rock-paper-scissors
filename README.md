# rock-paper-scissors

An updated and visualized version of previous Rock-Paper-Scissors
which was working on console level

This version consists of 3 buttons on HTML page which receives input
from user and play the game in background until one player reaches
5 points total.

And again. Its a dummy project. don't take it seriously.
